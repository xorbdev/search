# Sitemap

Because the data already exists from indexing your site for search, the
ability to generate a sitemap is available and can be enabled in the plugin's
settings.

## Configuring a Result

Similar to search results, you can enable and disable items from appearing in
the sitemap as well as set its priority and update frequency.
