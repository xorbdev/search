# Page Score

Page score works by tracking which pages your users land on the most and
serves them up before less popular pages.

## Track Page Hits

In order for page score to work, you must first enable the `Track Page Hits` option.

When enabled, each time a user lands on a page it will tracked in the database.

## Hit Score Period

You can specify the cutoff for when page hits no longer matter. This will make it so that
really popular, but no longer relevant, event from three years ago isn't the first result.

## Weighted Hits

When enabled recent hits will carry more weight than older hits.
