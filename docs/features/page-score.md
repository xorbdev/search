# Page Score

Page score works by tracking which pages your users land on the most and
serves them up before less popular pages.

## Track Page Hits

In order for page score to work, you must first enable the `Track Page Hits` option.

When enabled, each time a user lands on a page it will be tracked in the database.

## Hit Score Period

You can specify the cutoff for when page hits no longer matters. This will make it so that a
really popular, but no longer relevant, event from three years ago isn't the first result.

## Weighted Hits

When enabled recent hits will carry more weight than older hits.
