# Query Tracking

Enabling query tracking will allow you to see what your users are searching for
This information can be used to make adjustments to your term maps and
priorities or offer more detailed meta information for popular results.

Once enabled, a link to view queries will appear in the menu.

As an example, in the above image the user searched for `console cmds`.
It would make sense to add a term map to map `commands` to `cmds` so that the
`console commands` doc page would show up for this query.

## Recent Searches Widget

You may add a recent searches widget to your dashboard to display.
