# Result

The `Title`, `URI`, and `Description` fields of a result are read only and are
filled in automatically when updating the index. If you wish to override these,
add a custom field for use in your search results template.

## Search Enabled

Only items with `Search Enabled` switched on will appear in your search results.

## Search Priority

Results with a higher priority will appear first in your search results,
regardless of page score.

## Sitemap Enabled

Similarly, only items with `Sitemap Enabled` will appear in your sitemap.

## Rules Enabled

By default, `Search Enabled`, and `Site Enabled` will get updated automatically
based on your ignore rules and settings. To prevent this from happening, you
can turn off `Rules Enabled.`

In the above image, since we don't want the home page to appear in the
search results, we have switched off the rules and search toggles.

## Custom Field Layouts

You can add custom fields to your results.
